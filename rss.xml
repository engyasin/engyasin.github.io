However, organizing one's schedule can be challenging, for instance one is faced with the problem of distributing work and rest times in optimal time windows. To address this issue, analyzing previous working schedules of an individual may provide useful recommendations for him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As a researcher this can not only waste additional time, but also money and resources. In this article, we will demonstrate how traditional rule-based methods have a hidden edge (beside simplicity) in solving complex problems that require automation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some warn againt it, because it may cause dispointment and even a new AI winter. But here I will talk about the bottelneck of AI research that I come across in my work. It may be not be called a winter, but it's difinitely will cause a slow down in the field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, look at the bright side. This means you still have room for improvment :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
