As a researcher this can not only waste additional time, but also money and resources. In this article, we will demonstrate how traditional rule-based methods have a hidden edge (beside simplicity) in solving complex problems that require automation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some warn againt it, because it may cause dispointment and even a new AI winter. But here I will talk about the bottelneck of AI research that I come across in my work. It may be not be called a winter, but it's difinitely will cause a slow down in the field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, look at the bright side. This means you still have room for improvment :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
